{"data":{"projects":{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Linear Algebra Matrix Calculator","tech":["C","GCC"],"github":"https://github.com/aldellar/Matrix-Calculator","external":null},"html":"<p>I built a matrix calculator in vanilla JavaScript that supports basic operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication. It features a simple interface for entering matrices and updates the results instantly without needing a page refresh. It was a great way to sharpen my JavaScript and DOM skills while keeping the UI clean and responsive.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Slug Dining","tech":["C","POSIX Threads"],"github":"https://github.com/aldellar/Slug-Dining","external":""},"html":"<p>I built a multithreaded C program that simulates a dining hall with students and janitors, each represented by threads. Only a few student threads can enter at a time, and janitor threads wait until the hall is empty to clean. I used mutexes and condition variables to control access and prevent race conditions.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Cryptor — Assembly-Level Encryption Tool","tech":["Assembly","x86","NASM"],"github":"https://github.com/aldellar/Cryptor","external":""},"html":"<p>I created a lightweight cryptography tool in assembly that uses XOR-based encryption and decryption for basic file security. It gave me a chance to dive deeper into low-level programming and get more comfortable working directly with memory and registers.</p>"}}]}}}
