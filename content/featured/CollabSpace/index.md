CollabSpace is a collaboration platform with secure login, user dashboards, and protected routes. The frontend is built in React with Material UI and Context API, and the backend uses Node.js and PostgreSQL. APIs are described with OpenAPI and validated with express-openapi-validator. Tests are written with Jest to ensure everything works reliably.

Key features include:

- JWT authentication for secure login and role-based access
- Responsive React UI styled with Material UI
- PostgreSQL for relational data modeling
- OpenAPI-based request/response validation
- Jest tests for frontend and backend logic
