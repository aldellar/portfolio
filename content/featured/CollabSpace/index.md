CollabSpace is a full-stack collaboration platform featuring secure authentication, user-specific dashboards, and protected routes. The frontend is built with React, using Material UI and the Context API, while the backend runs on Node.js with a PostgreSQL database. APIs are documented with OpenAPI and validated using express-openapi-validator. Comprehensive tests are written in Jest to ensure reliability across the stack.

Key features include:

- Secure JWT authentication with role-based access control
- Responsive React UI styled with Material UI
- Normalized relational data modeling in PostgreSQL
- Strict request/response validation via OpenAPI and express-openapi-validator
- Full-stack testing using Jest for frontend and backend logic
