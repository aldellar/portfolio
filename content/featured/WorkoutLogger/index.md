Workout Logger is a mobile app built with React Native and Node.js that helps users track workouts, log exercises, and monitor progress over time. Data is stored locally using AsyncStorage for offline access, and users can manage their profiles and track personal records (PRs) across sessions. The interface is built with modular components.

Key features include:

- Local data persistence via AsyncStorage
- Personal profiles with PR tracking and workout history
- Modular, reusable UI components (modals, cards)
