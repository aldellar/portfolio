I built a matrix calculator in vanilla JavaScript that supports basic operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication. It features a simple interface for entering matrices and updates the results instantly without needing a page refresh. It was a great way to sharpen my JavaScript and DOM skills while keeping the UI clean and responsive.
